- 👋 Hi, I’m @TalonLumini
- 👀 I’m interested in the Monster Hunter Franchise
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be an educator, though I am learning this so that I can create an encyclopedia of various Monster Hunter discoverings so that they can be found and not lost
under the sea of twitter and reddit posts as well as discord channels. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making a wikipedia-like site. 
- 📫 How to reach me on twitter @TLumini
